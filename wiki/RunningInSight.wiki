<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

!InSight can be [Installation installed] system-wide or run from the source directory in which it was built. For each of these options !InSight has to be invoked in a different way.

= Running !InSight =

!InSight consists of two parts: the front-end `insight` and the daemon `insightd`. The daemon contains all the intelligence of !InSight while the front-end serves only as a "dump" terminal to connect to the shell-like interface of the daemon.

== `insightd` ==

For manual inspection of a memory dump and first steps with !InSight, it is sufficient to run the daemon as a stand-alone foreground application. To do so, just run

{{{
insightd
}}}

if you installed !InSight globally, or, to run from the source directory you just built it, execute

{{{
cd insightd
./insightd.sh
}}}

instead. You will see the command prompt of the !InSight shell:

{{{
>>> _
}}}

You can try the `help` command for a list of available commands. A detailed description can be found at the [InSightShell Shell page].

For the purpose of simple batch processing, `insight` reads any available input from `stdin`, evaluates it line by line according to its [InSightShell shell syntax] and exits afterwards. The following example displays a list of available commands:

{{{
echo help | insightd
>>> help
The following represents a complete list of valid commands:
  binary      Allows to retrieve binary data through a socket connection
  diff        Generates a list of vectors corresponding to type IDs
  exit        Exits the program
  help        Displays some help for a command
  list        Lists various types of read symbols
  memory      Load or unload a memory dump
  script      Executes a QtScript script file
  show        Shows information about a symbol given by name or ID
  symbols     Allows to load, store or parse the kernel symbols
>>> Done, exiting.
}}}

=== Command Line Parameters for `insightd` ===

The following list explains the command line parameters for `insightd`:

|| *Parameter*                        || *Description* ||
|| `-d`, `--daemon`                   || Start as a background process and detach console ||
|| `-f`, `--foreground`               || Start as daemon but don't detach console, allowing to see diagnostic messages on the console ||
|| `-p` _srcdir_, `--parse` _srcdir_  || Parse the [LinuxDebugSymbols debugging symbols] from the given kernel source directory _srcdir_ ||
|| `-l` _infile_, `--load` _infile_   || Read in previously saved debugging symbols from _infile_ ||
|| `-m` _infile_, `--memory` _infile_ || Load a memory dump or live guest physical memory from _infile_ ||
|| `-h`, `--help`                     || Display list of command line parameters ||

A more up-to-date list might be available using the `--help` parameter from the command line:

{{{
insightd --help
}}}

== `insight` ==

The daemon part of !InSight can be run as background process without a visible shell. In that case `insight` can be used to connect to this shell and execute arbitrary [InSightShell shell commands]. If `insightd` is running in [#Command_Line_Parameters_for_insightd daemon mode], executing `insight` will connect to the daemon and show the shell's command prompt:

{{{
insight
Type "exit" to leave this shell.

>>> _
}}}

=== Command Line Parameters for `insight` ===

`insight` provides command line parameters to interact with the `insightd` deamon as well as to control it:

|| *Parameter*                              || *Description* ||
|| `-sp` _file_, `--parse-symbols` _srcdir_ || Parse the [LinuxDebugSymbols debugging symbols] from the given kernel source directory _srcdir_ ||
|| `-sl` _file_, `--load-symbols` _file_    || Read in previously saved debugging symbols from _file_ ||
|| `-ss` _file_, `--store` _file_           || Store the currently loaded debugging symbols as _file_ ||
|| `-ds`, `--start`                         || Start the !InSight daemon, if not already running ||
|| `-dk`, `--stop`                          || Stop the !InSight daemon, if it is running ||
|| `-dr`, `--status`                        || Show the status of the !InSight daemon ||
|| `-md`, `--list-memdumps`                 || List the currently loaded memory dumps ||
|| `-ml` _file_, `--load-memdump` _file_    || Load a memory dump from _file_ ||
|| `-mu`, `--unload-memdump` _file_|_index_ || Unload a previously memory dump loaded from _file_ or being listed in the list at index _index_ ||
|| `-c` _command_, `--eval` _command_       || Evaluates _command_ in !InSight's [InSightShell shell syntax] ||
|| `-h`, `--help`                           || Display list of command line parameters ||
