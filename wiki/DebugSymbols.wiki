= Introduction =

The foundation of !InSight's ability to extract kernel objects out of physical memory are the debugging symbols of the Linux kernel being analyzed. How these symbols can be obtained depends on the operating system begin analyzed.

= Linux =

Analyzing a Linux machine is fully supported by !InSight. The process of generating debugging symbols for a kernel is described on a separate page.

See: LinuxDebugSymbols

= Windows =

Due to the closed nature of the Windows operating system, !InSight does not yet support analyzing Windows systems. We plan to add this feature in a future version (see RoadMap).
