#summary Installing the Debian packages

= Introduction =

This page describes how to install the Debian packages we provide for Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distributions.


= Installing the Packages from the Command Line =

First download at least the `libinsight`, `insight` and `insightd` packages from the [https://code.google.com/p/insight-vmi/downloads/list download page]. You may want to download the package `insight-scripts` with some sample scripts as well.

Install these packages with the `dpkg` package manager from the command line:

<code language="sh">sudo dpkg -i \
  libinsight_0.4_amd64.deb \
  insight_0.4_amd64.deb \
  insight-daemon_0.4_amd64.deb</code>

In the same way, you can install any other package you downloaded in addition.
