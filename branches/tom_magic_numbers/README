=== INTRODUCTION ===

This is InSight, a tool for bridging the semantic gap in the field of virtual
machine introspection (VMI) and digital forensics. It has been created by
Christian Schneider <chrschn@sec.in.tum.de> as part of his PhD thesis.

The InSight project is hosted on Google Code with lots of additional information
and documentation: https://code.google.com/p/insight-vmi/

=== INSTALLATION ===

Installation instructions for the impatient:

	make -f Makefile.manual

Detailed instructions can be found in the project wiki:
https://code.google.com/p/insight-vmi/wiki/Installation

Once the building succeeded, you can try out InSight without installation:

	./insightd/insightd.sh

You should see the command prompt of the InSight shell. Type in "help" to get a
short list of possible commands that you can run. Again, the project wiki
provides extended information about using the InSight shell:
